# Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis

The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset offers a comprehensive collection of reviews on fine foods available on Amazon.

Objective:
Our primary aim is to develop a model capable of accurately categorizing reviews as positive or negative. While the 'Score' column serves as a direct indicator, we aim to focus on analyzing the review text itself. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, we will construct a predictive model to determine the sentiment of future reviews.

Task:
Given a review, the goal is to classify it as positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).
